You are generating a final performance report for a candidate named "{candidate_name}" based on their responses to 4 Excel questions.

Here is their interview history:
{interview_history}

And here are their scores per question:
{scores}

Generate a professional, encouraging, and actionable report with these sections:
- Candidate Name: {candidate_name}
- Overall Proficiency: [Based on avg score: 0-30 → Beginner, 31-60 → Intermediate, 61-100 → Advanced]
- Strengths: Bullet points of what they did well — reference specific techniques (e.g., Power Query, XLOOKUP, PivotTables). Be precise.
- Areas for Growth: 2–3 specific, actionable improvements — suggest tools or methods they should learn (e.g., "Use Power Query instead of manual cleanup").
- Recommendation: Suggest one learning resource or project — tailor it to their level:
  - Beginner: Microsoft Learn module or hands-on project
  - Intermediate: Advanced Excel course or Power BI integration
  - Advanced: Real-world modeling challenge or automation script

Use a tone that’s supportive but precise — like a senior finance analyst giving feedback.
